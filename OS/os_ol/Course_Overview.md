# Learning Goals

## What are operating systems?

## why are operating systems needed?

## How are operating systems designed and implemented?



### OS abstractions, mechanisms, and policies for :  related

* processes and process management
* threads and concurrency
* resource management : scheduling, memory management
* OS services for communication and I/O
* OS  support for distributed services
* systems software for data center and cloud environments

## # Sequence of programming Projects:

* threads, concurrency, and synchronization
* single-node OS mechanisms
  * inter-process communication, scheduling
* multi-node OS mechanisms
  * remote procedure calls (RPC)
* Exprimental design and evaluation
